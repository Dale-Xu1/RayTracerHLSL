# Ray Tracer HLSL

# Overview

This is a simple ray tracer written as an HLSL compute shader in DirectX 11. The project is a Visual Studio solution, which includes a C# WPF project.
Currently, all it does is render a simple scene with a ground plane and some spheres with a skybox.

The ray tracer supports triangles and spheres, as well as diffuse and emissive materials.
It also supports depth of field and HDR through the Hill ACES tone mapping curve.
